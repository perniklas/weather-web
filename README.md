# weather-web
A simple and to-the-point web-based weather application for mobile devices.

The app is built with React and consumes APIs from api.met.no for weather and forecast data, and api.bigdatacloud.net for finding out the name of your nearest town if location access is consented. As of today it only lists Norwegian cities with a population greater than 5000 and the weather data is only for Norway.
Hosting is done by Firebase.
It's (as of yet) severely intended for mobile devices and not fullscreen desktop monitors.
